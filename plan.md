## What we have 
* Home page

* Player dashboard
* Host dashboard
* DB design
* Servlets
* JSP pages
* Hibernate setup and deployed locally
* Tests

### What we need for minimal Variable Product
-[ ] Approved project proposal
-[ ] Players can view story details: Story, clues, characters. 
-[ ] Players can add found clues to the clue page to share with everyone by submitting a pin attached to the physical clue.
-[ ] Easy to navigate web app that is aesthetically pleasing
-[ ] Plays can submit a guess at the end
-[ ] Host can CRUD: Story, characters, clues
-[ ] Host can push scenes or have them on a timer

### What we need to go the extra mile (or in Part 2)

## Logic needed for the app and things...


### page logic
4. hamburger menu for all pages 
5. jsp pages hosting all data for game
6. Story that is hosted on the story page, with story progression occurring as admin user pushes those updates to the story line for 3 different parts/scenes.
7. Characters page with some info on each character that can then be clicked on to reveal more details on selected character. Including relation, height, age, and other details related to case. 
8.
