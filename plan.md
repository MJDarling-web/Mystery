Started Plan
# Murder Mystery Plan

## Logic needed for the app and things...
1. _minimum_ admin login for select the story mode and how many players they want in a game?
2. _nice_ character login so users can be created by players associated with their login. This is where they can create backstory, skills, and other details. Characters are stored in the DB and can be viewed on the characters sheet.
3. Clues that hold an ID number the users input on the clues page, stored in the database and maintained by the admin.

### page logic
4. hamburger menu for all pages 
5. jsp pages hosting all data for game
6. Story that is hosted on the story page, with story progression occurring as admin user pushes those updates to the story line for 3 different parts/scenes.
7. Characters page with some info on each character that can then be clicked on to reveal more details on selected character. Including relation, height, age, and other details related to case.
