# Murder Mystery Plan
_What is this project?_ Visit the readme [readme](readme.md) file.
## What we have 
* Home page 
* Nav bars
* Player dashboard
* Host dashboard
* DB design
* Servlets
* JSP pages
* Hibernate setup and deployed locally
* Tests

### What we need for minimal Variable Product
- [x] Players look up story based on pin. 
- [x] Pages designs & readme
- [X] Approved project proposal
- [ ] Players can view story details: Story, clues, characters. 
- [ ] Players can add found clues to the clue page to share with everyone by submitting a pin attached to the physical clue.
- [ ] Easy to navigate web app that is aesthetically pleasing
- [ ] Plays can submit a guess at the end
- [ ] Host can CRUD: Story, characters, clues, and scenes.
- [ ] Host can see the "pin" to share with players for game lookup.
- [ ] Host can push scenes or have them on a timer - maybe a timer reminder for the host to get a notification to "push" the next scene?

### Ideas to go the extra mile (or in Part 2)
* Plays can create their own characters
* Implements an API 
* Incorporates  AI (maybe even something like weather to set the scene?)

#### Needed for hosts and players functions
HOST
- [x] View Host stories
- [ ] Finish building out host pages
- [ ] CRUD for host to create and edit "games"
- [ ] Action to post new scenes button for host or timer?
- [ ] Host sign-in through AWS
- [ ] Back buttons? Or a better UI instead of hamburger menu?
- [ ] Readme file with list of tools
- [ ] Plan
- [ ] Deployed on AWS


PLAYERS
- [ ] Player page for game look up with a code
- [ ] Story page to pull from DB by the story ID
- [ ] Clues page to pull from DB by the story ID and a way players can submit found clues
- [ ] Character page to pull from DB by story ID
- [ ] Players submit guess option
- [ ] Scenes to auto update on Story page based on host push of new scene
- [ ] delete admin dashboard on nav for story
